# 1.0.16 - 2025-07-17
- Added Jelly to Jellyfishes group (whoops) and as a result, toggled on Heavy Armor checkbox for Aurelids.

# 1.0.15 - 2025-07-17
- Added auto detection for mounts that haven't been manually added, they can be summoned and interacted with normally.

- Fixed occasionally summoning a random mount instead of G99.

# 1.0.13 - 2025-06-30

- Tidied up old comments that still said "New:", "Updated:", "Fixed:" etc, for changes that were made a while back.
