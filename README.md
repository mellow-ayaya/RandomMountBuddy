### About

This addon solves a niche issue with random summoning: if you've favorited multiple versions of the same mount (like several Cloud Serpent colors), you'll see that type too often. Random Mount Buddy picks a random mount type first, then a random color—ensuring better distribution across your favorites.
### &nbsp;
### How It Works

With default random summoning, favoriting multiple variants of the same mount creates heavily skewed odds. Here's a real example from version 1.0.22 with 711 flying mounts:

- Without Random Mount Buddy: Cloud Serpent ~4.36%, Ashes of Al'ar ~0.14%
- With Random Mount Buddy: Cloud Serpent ~1%, Ashes of Al'ar ~0.11% (Ashes now ~3.4x fairer relative to Cloud Serpent)

And that's just one way Random Mount Buddy balances heavily recolored mounts with unique ones!

*Technicalities: all Cloud Serpent and Ashes variants favorited; flying mount count includes faction exclusives so the ratio may vary slightly, but should remain similar.*
