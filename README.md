### About

This addon solves a niche issue with random summoning: if you've favorited multiple recolors or versions of the same mount (like several Cloud Serpent colors), you'll see them much more often compared to mounts with less recolors/variants. Random Mount Buddy picks a random mount type first, then a random color/variant, ensuring better distribution across your favorites.
### &nbsp;
### How It Works

With default random summoning, favoriting multiple variants of the same mount creates heavily skewed odds. Here's a real example from version 1.0.22 with 711 flying mounts:

- Without Random Mount Buddy: Cloud Serpent ~4.36%, Ashes of Al'ar ~0.14%
- With Random Mount Buddy: Cloud Serpent ~1%, Ashes of Al'ar ~0.11% (Ashes now ~3.4x fairer relative to Cloud Serpent)

And that's just one way Random Mount Buddy balances heavily recolored mounts with unique ones!

*Technicalities: all Cloud Serpent and Ashes variants favorited; flying mount count includes faction exclusives so the ratio may vary slightly, but should remain similar.*

### Features

Base features:
- Mounts with recolors are grouped in Families, similar Families are grouped in Groups.
- Instead of summoning an individual mount, the addon summons a random group or ungrouped family/mount.
- If you like seeing unique mounts like Alunira (unique gryphon variant), enable 'Favor Unique Mounts' to give them independent (better) summon chances instead of grouping them.
- Mount browser: see your entire mount collection grouped in Families and Groups and adjust various settings with ease such as weight and uniqueness.

Summoning features:
- Contextual Summoning: Automatically filters by flying/ground/swimming based on your location.
- Improved Randomness: Recently used mount families become temporarily unavailable for better variety.
- Weight System: Prioritize your favorites while still getting variety.
- Favorite Sync: Automatically sync with your WoW Mount Journal favorites.
- D.R.I.V.E. support: Automatically summon G-99 Breakneck when in the correct zones.
- Macros: Create macros using /run RMB:SRM(true) or /rmb s. Note: Macros won't automatically use class spells like Travel Form - you'll need to add those manually if desired.
- Rules: Create rules to summon specific mounts in specific conditions such as player level, zone, instance type, while in party with a friend, when using a specific keybind, and more!

Utility features:
- Press the addon keybind to use class spells such as Flight/Travel/Cat form depending on the situation, or Levitate while falling! Classes supported: Druid, Shaman, Mage, Monk, Priest.
