### About

Tired of your "random" mount button giving you recolors of the same mounts over and over again? With hundreds of mounts in the game, why do you keep getting Cloud Serpents when you have Ashes of Al'ar sitting unused in your collection?

Random Mount Buddy organizes your mounts, then picks randomly from mount types instead of individual mounts. This means your 15 different Cloud Serpent recolors count as one "Cloud Seprent" entry, giving your unique mounts like Invincible or Ashes of Al'ar a fair chance to be selected.

Here's what you can expect: mount categorization based on model, settings that allow you to easily configure which types of mounts should be considered unique, automatic summon chance managing based on your favorite mounts, and more!
### &nbsp;
### How It Works

Mount Grouping: Similar-looking mounts are grouped together (all those dragon recolors become "Dragons")
Balanced Selection: The mount summon process picks a mount type, then a variant within that type
Result: Actually see variety in your mount collection instead of the same  models over and over

### Features

Mount Summoning related features:

Contextual Summoning: Automatically filters by flying/ground/swimming based on your location
Improved Randomness: Recently used mount families become temporarily unavailable for better variety
Full Customization: Don't like how something is grouped? Move families around, create custom groups, or separate individual mounts
Mount Traits: Each grouped Mount Family has traits that you can adjust, such as: Small Armor, Large Armor, Updated Texture and Unique.
Summoning Uniqueness Strictness: Easily toggle which traits you consider different enough in the general settings.
Weight System: Prioritize your favorites while still getting variety
Favorite Sync: Automatically sync with your WoW Mount Journal favorites
D.R.I.V.E. support: Automatically summon G-99 Breakneck when in the correct zones.
Macros: You can create macros that use the addon's summoning logic, however, summoning a mount via this method does not support class spells or G-99 Breakneck. The command for macros is /run RMB:SRM(true)

Utility features:

Press the addon keybind to use class spells such as Flight/Travel/Cat form depending on the situation, or Levitate while falling! Classes supported: Druid, Shaman, Mage, Monk, Priest.
